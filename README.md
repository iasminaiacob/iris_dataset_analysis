The Iris dataset is a classic dataset widely used in statistical and machine learning analyses. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. 
Each observation includes four numeric measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset to understand its statistical properties,
perform hypothesis testing, and build a predictive model to classify flower species based on their features. 

Problems Studied:
  Descriptive Statistics: Examine the distribution of variables using summary statistics and visualizations. 
  Hypothesis Testing: Analyze whether Petal.Length differs significantly across species using ANOVA. 
  Predictive Modeling: Build a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model to classify flowers by species based on their measurements. 

Conclusions:
  Descriptive Statistics:  
    Sepal and petal measurements vary significantly across species. 
    Setosa is distinctly different in terms of petal length and width. 
  Hypothesis Testing:  
    Petal Length differs significantly across species (ANOVA, p < 0.001). 
    Post-hoc tests show pairwise differences. 
  Predictive Model:  
    The k-NN model accurately classified species with 100% accuracy on the test set.
